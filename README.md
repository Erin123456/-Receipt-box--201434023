+Recently,l loaded a software called Receipts box . 
It is used to record expenditure and income in daily life .
Because of having this software . I become very happy .
Last term,I rarely knew how much I spent and what I did .
When I entered the University,I made up my mind in taking notes of my expenditure ,but I had to write them down on the paper with my hand ï¼Œwhich made it very troublesome .
Because it is not suited to take notes whenever you can and you must write down after coming back to your bedchamber.
Sometimes ,I had already forgotten what I bought .
Besides, when I was busy , I would be lazy to do this thing .
Once you stop to do it someday. It is almost impossible to continue to take notes of your expenditure.
However,the software called Receipts box can help me solve these problems .
As long as I spend money, I will record my expenditure with this software ,which I will not forget.
The more important advantage is that it is so convenient that it will be achieved only by inputting digit and clicking "ok",which can help you save your time .
In addition,it also includes various of classifications such as diet,medial treatment,dress and personal adornment and so on.
What is more ,it also has the function of exporting the bill .
you can export you bill every month to know what you ever did .
And one of the most that I like is that it counts the percentages of the part expenditure in total.
Thus , you will clearly know which costs more money .it is diet or dressing 
.But , I think that ,it also has a disadvantage that I can only record the category which you spend in,but not to take notes the specific item which you bought,such as rice,bread and coat so on.
So I think it can be improved from this point. 
Thank you,that is all.
